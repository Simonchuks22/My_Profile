## My process
To Attempt it you need the basic understanding of HTML and CSS frameworks
1) first of all structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
2)Then input CSS framework (Bootstrap)on your index.html file 
3)Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
4) Create a GITHUB Repository,Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code and host it. 
5) Then push your codes to github repo using GIt and deploy it

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 
- CSS custom properties
- CSS framework (Bootstrap)

### What I learned

I learn a lot on CSS framework, building projects with framework that makes it easier than Vanila CSS

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="text-center container me ms p m ">
<h1>my name is simon</h1>
</div>
```
```    

}
}

```
